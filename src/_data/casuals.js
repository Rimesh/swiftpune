// Casuals — every monthly brunch, newest first, plus the annual WWDC
// watch party.
//
// TO ADD A CASUAL (C003, C004, …): drop its photos in
// assets/Events/Casuals/00N/ as 01/02/03, then add an entry to the TOP of
// `events`. The first entry is featured on /casuals; the rest become
// expanded rows in the casuals log. The homepage card follows.
//
// TO ADD A WATCH PARTY: add an entry to the TOP of `annual`. With two or
// more, the older ones get a log of their own under the featured one.
